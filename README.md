### Paste image

![picture 3](/assets/screenshot-paste-img.png)

This is a command and extension menu for folders in the source explorer. Take an image stored on clipboard and paste as a new image inside the selected folder. The name of the new file is a number obtained using the TypeScript expression `new Date().getTime()`, the extension is added based on next rules:

- For Windows if there is a gif image on clipboard, a new .gif image will be created, any other image type on clipboard will be resolved as .png.
- For Linux and Mac any image type on clipboard will be resolved as .png.

Both features can accessed through command pallete: `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift P`. Make sure you have the appropriated selected item in the source explorer.
