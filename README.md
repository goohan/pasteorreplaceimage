# Paste or replace image from clipboard

This extension allows you to replace an existing image with an image stored in clipboard. It also allows you to paste a new image from clipboard into a folder.

Image data must be copied to clipboard (like when using Paint, Snipping tools or Image Viewer), file copy only (File Explorer) will not work.

Next features can accessed through command pallete: `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift P`. Make sure you have the appropriated selected item in the source explorer and type feature name.

### Paste image

This is a command and extension menu for folders in the source explorer. Take an image stored on clipboard and paste as a new image inside the selected folder. The name of the new file is a number obtained using the TypeScript expression `new Date().getTime()`, the file extension is added based on next rules:

- For Windows if there is a gif image on clipboard, a new .gif image will be created, any other image type on clipboard will be resolved as .png.
- For Linux and Mac any image type on clipboard will be resolved as .png.

The resulting names are like `TargetFolder/1678056093011.png` or `TargetFolder/1678052302778.gif`.
